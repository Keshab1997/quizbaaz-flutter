/// Pure scoring rules for 1-vs-1 battles — no Flutter dependencies.
///
/// ## Formula
///
/// ```text
/// correct answer  →  base (10)
///                  + speed bonus  (up to 10 — with reading grace)
///                  + first bonus  (2 — locked in before the opponent)
///                  + streak bonus (2 × streak, capped at 6)
/// wrong / timeout →  0
/// ```
///
/// ## Reading Grace (new — human-like fairness)
///
/// Nobody can read and answer a question in under ~3 seconds (especially
/// dual-language Bengali + English). The first 20% of the question window
/// is a "reading grace zone" — any answer within this zone pays the **full**
/// speed bonus. After grace, the bonus decays linearly to 0 at the deadline.
///
/// This prevents the bot (which answers at 4–8.5 s) from always outscoring
/// a human student (who needs 5–9 s to read + think). A 4/5 vs 4/5 match
/// now lands within a few points instead of a 26-point blowout.
